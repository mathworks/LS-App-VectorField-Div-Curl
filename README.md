# Script content

- "Cartesian representation" section: In the first section of the Live Script, the user has to input the vector components (expressed in a Cartersian coordinate system) and chose the display setting (2D or 3D). Note that for a 2D display, the z-component will be dropped automatically. 
The vector field can be then displayed along with 2D colormaps for divergence and curl.

- "Using the DivCurl app" section: In the second section of the script, the user will be able to run an application designed to display vector fields and calculate divergence and curl. The user needs to select the representation (Cartesian, Spherical or Cylindrical) and input his vector components accordingly. The vector fields are only displayed in a Cartersian coordiante system. The two sliders in the top right corner, arrows and grid, can be varied by the user to provide optimal display.
